- 👋 Hi, I’m @l0newander3r
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology, ethics, and society. Think sustainable systems, human-centered design, and the occasional trek through the wilderness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a more equitable and sustainable future through ethical engineering and open-source collaboration. (Also, dabbling in Go and perfecting my sourdough starter).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that promote social responsibility, privacy-enhancing technologies, or alternative economic models. (Hit me up if you're fighting the good fight!).
- 📫 How to reach me: Find me lurking on @freenode, usually pontificating on the perils of late-stage capitalism.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can seamlessly switch between languages!
